 How does the user interact with your executable? How do you open and control the
software you wrote (exe file)?

The user will be shown a UI menu with a create button on it that they can click on. 
This will then take them to s create screen with a grid on it which will allow then 
to choses which price will be in each position by clicking on the location that they 
wish to change and then clicking in the piece that they would like to change it to 
from the selection around the grid.

While in the play mode the user/player will use the WASD keys to move around the maze 
and the mouse to look around. If the player gets to lost while in the maze, they can 
press the esc key to go back to the maze creator.

 How does the program code work? How do the classes and functions fit together and
who does what?

The product will be a maze creator proof of concept game where the user/player will 
create a maze 5x5 maze from a selection of 7 different predefined maze pieces and the 
user will also define the pieces rotation.

After this the user/player will be able to click a play button located at the bottom 
of the screen witch will generate the maze that they have just designed and place them 
as a first-person player in the centre of the start tile there goal is to then get to 
the finish with out getting to lost.


 What makes your program special and how does it compare to similar things? 
(Where did you get the idea from?
What did you start with? 
How did you make yours unique?
Did you start with a given project?)

 Include a link to a video report that details the above but also goes into more detail on:
 Anything else which will helps us understand how your prototype works.
 Are there any software engineering issues, such as the trade-off between
performance and good practice?
 A (brief) evaluation of what you think you have achieved, and what (if anything)
you would do differently, knowing what you now know. Feel free to blow your
trumpet!
